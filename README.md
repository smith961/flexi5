# Node.js 

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It's a system that executes JavaScript separately from the browser, providing a boost to processing times and being easy to set up. Node .js is also event-driven, meaning it can handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking.

## What is Node.js Used For?

 - Server-side programming
 - Real-time applications
 - Microservices architecture
 - APIs
 - Desktop applications
 - Machine learning
